# Cam-Profile-modelling
Modelling user-specified cam profile with Python Turtle
This program uses Python Turtle to draw out the profile of a disc cam whose follower's displacement is specified by various user inputs (from a .txt file) including the angular range, number of segments, type of motion, etc. After drawing, a simple endless animation depicts the disc cam rotating and the follower's corresponding motion due to this rotation. It is integrated with error catching measures.
